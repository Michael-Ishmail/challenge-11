This is my note taking app!

I used express JS to link each html and js file to so that the server delivers the correct content when it is requested. I have also added the ability for the notes to be stored in JSON format so that the server can store, retreive, and delete notes when the user requests it.

Below is my code deployed on Heroku, as well as the github repository:
